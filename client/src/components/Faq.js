           <p>What is the First Office Visit Like?</p>
           <p>The first step to improving your mental health is obtaining a proper diagnosis. This should always come before starting a treatment plan. A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation helps to uncover what diagnosis (or diagnoses) explain the symptoms, struggles and negative consequences you have experienced.

Your first visit is likely a similar experience to other medical professionals that you may have seen in the past. We will discuss what brought you into the office, in other words, “what we will be working on together.” Next, we’ll go through a series of questions together, regarding current and past mental health, general health, and family history. The initial appointment lasts about 60 minutes.</p>
<p> Can You Diagnosis Me in One Appointment?</p>
<p>Every patient is unique and comes with a history of different symptoms, life experiences, treatment failures, treatment successes and treatment options that have not been tried in the past. The goal is to help the patient determine an accurate diagnosis or diagnoses. Even if a diagnosis seems obvious, other conditions will be ruled out such as depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, anxiety, psychosis, addiction and certain medical conditions, as these conditions influence which medications and therapeutic treatment options would be most suitable. In some cases, it can take several follow up sessions to further clarify the diagnosis.</p>
